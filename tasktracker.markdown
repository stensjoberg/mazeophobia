# TODO

## Bug Squashing

- stop tracking mouse when escaping lock (low priority)

## Features

- Instructions after start screen
- End Screens for win/lose conditions
- Ambiance - textures, noise, effects (particle effect/torches) etc.
- Helping the player win: sound to guide player to the goal (dripping = good goal, ominous = bad guy) | ALTERNATIVELY, light beacon with a nighttime sky which helps guide player in right direction
- Wall textures to make the maze a bit less bland 
- Reduce maze density to make things less claustrophobic (may need to also play around with maze size and dimensions and w/e)

## Technical Stuff

- Add clean up functions to scenes 
- Refactor gamescene with each element as own object
